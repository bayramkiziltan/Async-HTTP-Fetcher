# Technical Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the technical implementation details of the Async HTTP Fetcher library, detailing what was implemented in each file and the reasoning behind the architectural decisions.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Fetcher Module**: Core HTTP client functionality
- **Utils Module**: Reusable utilities for logging, timing, and context management
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all components

## File-by-File Implementation Analysis

### Core Fetcher Components

#### `src/fetcher/fetcher.py`

**What was implemented:**
```python
async def _fetch(session, url, semaphore)
async def fetch_all(urls, concurrency=100)
```

**Technical decisions:**

1. **Semaphore-based Concurrency Control**
   - Used `asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency)` to limit simultaneous connections
   - Prevents overwhelming target servers and memory exhaustion
   - Allows fine-tuned performance control

2. **Intelligent Timeout Strategy**
   ```python
   timeout = (
       10 if "/delay/" in url else
       8 if "/status/" in url else 6
   )
   ```
   - URL-pattern based timeout assignment
   - Accounts for expected response times of different endpoint types
   - Balances responsiveness with reliability

3. **Connection Pool Optimization**
   ```python
   conn = aiohttp.TCPConnector(
       limit=concurrency * 2,
       ttl_dns_cache=300,
       force_close=False,
       enable_cleanup_closed=True,
       use_dns_cache=True
   )
   ```
   - Connection pool size scaled to concurrency level
   - DNS caching for 5 minutes to reduce lookup overhead
   - Connection reuse for better performance

4. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
   ```python
   for attempt in range(3):
       try:
           # ... attempt request ...
       except Exception as e:
           if attempt < 2:
               await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
   ```
   - 3-attempt retry strategy
   - Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
   - Graceful handling of network instability

**Why this approach:**
- **Performance**: Async/await maximizes I/O throughput
- **Reliability**: Retry logic handles transient failures
- **Resource Management**: Connection pooling and semaphores prevent resource exhaustion
- **Flexibility**: Configurable concurrency and timeouts

#### `src/fetcher/fetcher_logger.py`

**What was implemented:**
```python
def log_batch_start(total_urls, concurrency)
def log_request_result(url, success, duration, error=None)
def log_batch_completion(successful, failed, total_time)
```

**Technical decisions:**

1. **Specialized Logging Module**
   - Dedicated logging functions for HTTP operations
   - Consistent log format across the application
   - Performance metrics integration

2. **Structured Log Messages**
   - Includes timing, success/failure rates, and error details
   - Enables easy parsing for monitoring systems
   - Provides actionable debugging information

**Why this approach:**
- **Maintainability**: Centralized logging logic
- **Observability**: Comprehensive performance and error tracking
- **Debugging**: Detailed request-level information

### Utility Components

#### `src/utils/timer.py`

**What was implemented:**
```python
def timer(func_name=None):
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Timing logic for async functions
```

**Technical decisions:**

1. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Non-intrusive performance monitoring
   - Reusable across different functions
   - Preserves original function signatures

2. **Async/Await Support**
   - Handles both sync and async functions
   - Uses `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` for detection
   - Proper coroutine execution

3. **High-Precision Timing**
   - Uses `time.perf_counter()` for accurate measurements
   - Microsecond precision for performance analysis
   - Suitable for both short and long-running operations

**Why this approach:**
- **Non-invasive**: Functions don't need modification
- **Precise**: High-resolution timing measurements
- **Flexible**: Works with any async function

#### `src/utils/context_utils.py`

**What was implemented:**
```python
class AsyncTimerContext:
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.perf_counter()
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        # Timing and logging logic
```

**Technical decisions:**

1. **Async Context Manager**
   - Implements `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` protocols
   - Automatic resource management and cleanup
   - Exception-safe timing measurements

2. **Exception Handling Integration**
   - Tracks timing even when exceptions occur
   - Provides context for error analysis
   - Ensures cleanup always happens

3. **Flexible Block Timing**
   - Can time any code block, not just functions
   - Useful for timing complex operations
   - Alternative to decorator pattern

**Why this approach:**
- **Resource Safety**: Guaranteed cleanup via context protocol
- **Exception Safety**: Timing continues even with errors
- **Flexibility**: Can time arbitrary code blocks

#### `src/utils/logging_policy.py`

**What was implemented:**
```python
@dataclass
class LogConfig:
    level: int = logging.INFO
    file_path: str = "logs/app.log"
    console_output: bool = True

class LoggingPolicy:
    def __init__(self, config: LogConfig):
        # Centralized logging configuration
```

**Technical decisions:**

1. **Configuration-Driven Logging**
   - Dataclass for type-safe configuration
   - Centralized policy management
   - Environment-specific configurations

2. **Dual Output Strategy**
   - File logging for persistence
   - Console output for development
   - Configurable output destinations

3. **Hierarchical Logger Setup**
   - Root logger configuration
   - Module-specific logger inheritance
   - Consistent formatting across application

**Why this approach:**
- **Consistency**: Unified logging behavior
- **Flexibility**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Maintainability**: Single point of logging policy
